# Events Scrapper

This is a simple scrapper that fetches events from different events website. The events are then stored in a database and can be accessed through an API. I have built a simple frontend to display the events.

2. Install the requirements
```bash
pnpm install

3. Download playwright browsers

pnpm exec playwright install  
```

```
